Abstract Placer Distribution Module
===================================

Overview
--------

The `abstract_placer_distribution` module is a cornerstone of the PITA Algorithm's asset placement system, providing a structured approach to defining distributions for object placement within simulations. This module introduces an abstract base class that outlines the necessary interface and shared functionalities for all distribution strategies used by placer classes to determine object positions.

Key Features
------------

- **Uniform Distribution Interface**: Establishes a standard for implementing various distribution strategies, ensuring consistency and predictability in how objects are placed within the simulation environment.
- **Foundation for Extensible Distributions**: Acts as a base for creating diverse placement distributions, from simple uniform distributions to complex, pattern-based ones, allowing for tailored environmental setups.
- **Integration with Object Placers**: Designed to seamlessly work with the `abstract_placer` framework, enabling placer classes to utilize different distribution strategies for object placement, enhancing the versatility and realism of simulation scenarios.

Design Principles
-----------------

The `AbstractPlacerDistribution` class encapsulates the essence of distribution strategies within the PITA Algorithm, emphasizing extensibility, modularity, and ease of integration:

- **Extensibility**: Facilitates the addition of new distribution strategies by extending the `AbstractPlacerDistribution` class, encouraging innovation and customization in simulation design.
- **Modularity**: Promotes a modular architecture by defining a clear, focused interface for distribution strategies, simplifying the integration process with existing and future placer classes.
- **Ease of Integration**: Ensures that new distribution strategies can be easily adopted by object placers, allowing for straightforward enhancements to the environmental complexity and dynamism.

Usage
-----

Implementing a custom distribution strategy involves extending the `AbstractPlacerDistribution` class and defining the specific logic for object placement:

1. **Define a New Distribution Strategy**: Derive a new class from `AbstractPlacerDistribution`, implementing the abstract methods to define the distribution logic.
2. **Implement Distribution Logic**: Override necessary methods to specify how objects should be distributed within the environment, according to the strategy's principles.
3. **Utilize in Object Placers**: Reference the custom distribution class within object placer implementations to apply the new strategy during simulation setup and execution.

For those who would love to tinker with the PITA framework on their own, the `abstract_placer_distribution` module provides a powerful tool for developers and researchers to craft highly customized and dynamic simulation environments, supporting a broad spectrum of experimental designs and hypotheses testing.
