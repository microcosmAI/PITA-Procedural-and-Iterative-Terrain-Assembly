Usage Guide
================================================

The Peter Algorithm is a versatile framework designed for [insert purpose or a brief description here]. This guide outlines the steps required to configure, execute, and customize the algorithm, ensuring users can fully leverage its capabilities for their projects.

Setup and Installation
----------------------

Before diving into the Peter Algorithm, ensure your environment is correctly set up with all necessary dependencies and the algorithm itself.

**Prerequisites:**

- Python 3.x
- [Other dependencies, if any]

**Installation Steps:**

1. Clone the repository or download the Peter Algorithm source code.
2. Navigate to the algorithm's directory.
3. Install required dependencies:

   .. code-block:: bash

      pip install -r requirements.txt

Configuration
-------------

The Peter Algorithm can be tailored through configuration files or parameters. Here’s how to set it up for your specific use case.

**Configuration File:**

Create a `config.yml` (or similar) file to specify various parameters such as [insert key parameters, e.g., "environment settings, object types, simulation parameters"].

.. code-block:: yaml

   # Example configuration
   parameter1: value1
   parameter2: value2

**Command Line Parameters:**

Alternatively, you may configure the algorithm through command-line arguments when executing the script.

Execution
---------

To run the Peter Algorithm, use the following command template, adjusting parameters as needed based on your configuration method:

.. code-block:: bash

   python peter_algorithm.py --config config.yml

Or, if using command-line parameters:

.. code-block:: bash

   python peter_algorithm.py --parameter1 value1 --parameter2 value2

Interpreting Results
--------------------

Upon completion, the Peter Algorithm will [describe the output, e.g., "generate a detailed report, output file, or visual representation of the algorithm’s execution"].

- **Output Files:** Located in [specify the default or specified output directory].
- **Visualization:** If applicable, the algorithm may produce a visual output which can be found at [insert visualization output location].

Customization and Extensions
-----------------------------

The Peter Algorithm is designed with customization in mind. Here’s how you can adapt it to fit your needs better:

- **Modifying Configuration Files:** Adjust parameters in the `config.yml` file to fine-tune the algorithm’s behavior.
- **Extending the Code:** Implement additional features or modifications by extending the base classes provided in [specify files or modules].

Troubleshooting
---------------

If you encounter issues while using the Peter Algorithm, consider the following troubleshooting steps:

- Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed and up-to-date.
- Verify your configuration files are correctly formatted and located in the expected directory.
- Consult the algorithm’s documentation for guidance on specific error messages or behavior.
