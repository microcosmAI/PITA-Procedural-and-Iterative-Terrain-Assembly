Height Rule Module
================

Overview
--------

The `HeightRule` class implements a specific rule within the PITA Algorithm framework's asset placement system, ensuring that objects are placed at or above a specified height from the ground level. This rule is essential for simulations requiring control over the vertical distribution of objects, contributing to the realism and accuracy of the simulated environment.

Key Features
------------

- **Height Verification**: Validates the vertical position of objects against a predefined ground level, ensuring they meet the minimum height requirements.

- **Flexible Ground Level Definition**: Allows for the dynamic setting of the ground level, accommodating simulations with varying terrain elevations or multiple ground layers.

- **Seamless Integration**: Works in conjunction with other rules and the overall asset placement system, enhancing the placement process without introducing complexity.
