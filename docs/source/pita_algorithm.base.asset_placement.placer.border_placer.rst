BorderPlacer Class
==================

Overview
--------

The `BorderPlacer` class is designed to automate the placement of border objects around the perimeter of the environment in the PITA Algorithm framework. This specialized placer ensures that borders are added efficiently and correctly, enhancing the environmental structure and providing clear demarcation lines for the simulated area.

Functionality
-------------

- **Automated Border Placement**: Automatically calculates the optimal positions for border objects based on the dimensions of the environment and the size of the border objects themselves.
  
- **Dynamic Adjustment**: Adapts the size and orientation of border objects to fit the environment's perimeter, ensuring a seamless bordering effect regardless of the environment's size.
  
- **Customizable Amount**: Allows for the specification of the number of borders to be placed, with a default setting that typically accommodates the four cardinal directions.

Implementation
--------------

Upon initialization, the `BorderPlacer` does not require any specific parameters, making it ready for immediate use
