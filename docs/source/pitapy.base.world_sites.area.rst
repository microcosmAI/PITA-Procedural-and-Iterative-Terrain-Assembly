Area Module
==========

Overview
--------

The `Area` class is a specialized implementation of the `AbstractSite` interface within the PITA Algorithm framework, designed to represent a specific area within a larger simulation environment. Areas can contain objects and have defined boundaries that constrain object placement, facilitating detailed organization and partitioning of the simulation space.

Key Features
------------

- **Environment Integration**: Directly associates with an `Environment` instance, ensuring consistency in physical properties and model definitions across the simulation.

- **Object Management**: Implements methods for adding and removing MuJoCo objects, allowing dynamic composition of the area's content.

- **Spatial Constraints**: Supports the definition of boundaries, enabling restrictions on object placements within the area to model complex environments accurately.

Usage
-----

1. **Initialization**: The `Area` class accepts parameters such as name, size, associated environment, and optional boundary constraints.

2. **Object Management**: The `add` and `remove` methods manage the MuJoCo objects within the area, adhering to any defined spatial constraints.

3. **Simulation Integration**: Incorporates the area into the broader simulation environment, utilizing its properties and objects as part of the simulation dynamics.
