Rule Abstract Module
===================

Overview
--------

The `Rule` abstract class provides a framework for defining rules that govern the placement of objects within the PITA Algorithm simulation environments. Derived classes implement specific logic to validate object placements against defined spatial constraints, environmental conditions, or other custom criteria, enhancing the realism and functionality of simulations.

Key Features
------------

- **Abstract Methods**: Includes abstract methods that must be implemented by subclasses, ensuring that each rule has a consistent interface for checking rule satisfaction.
  
- **Flexible Rule Definition**: Supports a wide range of rule types, from simple distance constraints to complex geometric conditions, allowing for detailed environment customization.

- **Integration with Placement Process**: Works in conjunction with the asset placement system, enabling dynamic validation of object placements within environments or specific areas.
