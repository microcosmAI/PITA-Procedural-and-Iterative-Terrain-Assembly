Environment Module
=================

Overview
--------

The `Environment` class is a pivotal component of the PITA Algorithm framework, representing the entire simulation space. It extends the `AbstractSite` class, providing functionalities for defining the physical size of the simulation environment, managing objects within it, and applying visual styles for enhanced simulation realism.

Key Features
------------

- **Comprehensive Simulation Space**: Defines the entirety of the simulation environment, including its physical dimensions and the objects it contains.

- **Visual Customization**: Supports the application of a "pretty mode" for enhanced visual realism and optional headlight configurations for lighting adjustments.

- **Object Management**: Implements methods for adding and removing objects from the environment, leveraging the MuJoCo physics engine for accurate simulation dynamics.
