Assembler Module
================

Overview
--------

The Assembler module is central to the PITA Algorithm, orchestrating the construction of dynamic and randomized environments for language emergence and reinforcement learning experiments. It leverages configuration inputs to place objects, define areas, and apply rules, creating diverse simulation scenarios tailored to various research requirements.

Key Features
------------

- **Dynamic Environment Assembly**: Leverages user-defined YAML configurations to guide the generation of simulation environments, offering extensive customization and variability.
- **Object Placement Strategy**: Implements sophisticated algorithms for placing objects within the environment, supporting both fixed and randomized placement schemes.
- **Rule Application**: Incorporates a versatile system for enforcing constraints and rules on object placements, ensuring environments adhere to specific research protocols or mimic physical realism.
- **Modular Design**: Built with modularity in mind, allowing for easy extension or modification to introduce new object types, environments, or placement rules.

Usage
-----

The Assembler serves as the gateway for generating simulation environments, reading from YAML configuration files that detail environment specifications, including object types, placement strategies, and applicable rules. The workflow typically involves:

1. **Configuration**: Creating a YAML file that outlines the environment layout, objects, and rules.
2. **Initialization**: Initializing the Assembler with this configuration to set up the environment assembly process.
3. **Execution**: The Assembler then proceeds to construct the environment, place objects, and enforce rules, resulting in a ready-to-use simulation scenario.

This process facilitates rapid environment prototyping, proving invaluable for AI, machine learning, and robotics research and development.
