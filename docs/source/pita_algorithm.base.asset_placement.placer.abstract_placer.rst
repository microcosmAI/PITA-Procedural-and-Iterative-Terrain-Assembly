Abstract Placer Module
======================

Overview
--------

The `AbstractPlacer` class lays the groundwork for all object placement strategies within the PITA Algorithm framework. Serving as an abstract base class, it defines a common interface for object placement, ensuring consistency and facilitating the development of customizable placement strategies. By dictating how objects are added to or removed from the simulation environment, it plays a crucial role in shaping the dynamics and realism of simulated scenarios.

Key Functionalities
-------------------

- **Object Copying**: Provides the capability to create deep copies of Mujoco object blueprints, allowing for the reuse of object configurations while maintaining unique instances in the simulation.
  
- **User Input Validation**: Ensures that user-specified color and size groups are compatible with the total amount of objects to be placed, preventing configuration errors and enhancing simulation reliability.
  
- **Abstract Methods**: Defines abstract methods such as `add` and `remove` for adding objects to or removing objects from a site, which concrete subclasses must implement according to specific placement logic.

Extensibility and Customization
-------------------------------

- **Custom Placement Strategies**: Developers can extend the `AbstractPlacer` class to implement custom object placement strategies, enabling simulations to accommodate a wide array of experimental setups and requirements.
  
- **Validation Integration**: Incorporates validators to check the suitability of object placements, allowing for the enforcement of spatial constraints and interaction rules.
